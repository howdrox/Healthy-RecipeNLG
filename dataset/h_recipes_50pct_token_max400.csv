Halve an avocado lengthwise and remove the pit.

Now if you want cubes, cut crosswise lines the same way.<NEXT_INSTR>With a soup spoon placed right under the skin, scoop out the flesh (already in ready-to-use slices or cubes!). Repeat with second half.

Do not push it to the very bottom.<NEXT_INSTR>Place the mould into your freezer. Wait for half a day or so and the ice pops will be ready!<NEXT_INSTR>To take the ice pops out of the mould, first prepare a bowl or a cup of hot water.

If the ice-cream stick slides out without your ice pop, just keep everything back into its original form and place it back into the freezer again.

"<RECIPE_START><INPUT_START>peanuts<INPUT_END><INGR_START>1 cup raw peanuts, with or without their papery skins<INGR_END><INSTR_START>Place a cast-iron or other heavy skillet over medium heat, add the peanuts, and cook, stirring them frequently with a wooden spoon or spatula to prevent burning. Adjust the heat if necessary so they toast and change color gradually, in patches; as they heat up, the skins, if still on, will separate from the peanuts. When they have firmed up a little and are dotted with color, remove from the heat, but keep stirring for another minute or so.<NEXT_INSTR>If using skin-on nuts, carry the skillet over to a sink or a garbage can and blow over it gently to blow away the loose skins. Rub the nuts between your palms to loosen the remaining skins and blow again; don't worry if there are still some skins on your peanuts. Pick out and discard any nuts that are scorched and blackened. Transfer the nuts to a wide bowl and set aside for 10 minutes or more to cool and firm up.<NEXT_INSTR>Once the peanuts are cool, place them in a food processor and process in short, sharp pulses, stopping after three or four pulses, before the nuts are too finely ground. You want a mix of coarsely chopped nuts and some fine powder. Alternatively, place the nuts in a large stone or terra-cotta mortar and pound with the pestle to crush them into smaller pieces. Use a spoon to move the nuts around occasionally; you don't want to pound them into a paste, just to break them into small chips.<NEXT_INSTR>Transfer the chopped nuts to a clean, dry jar; do not seal until they have cooled completely. Store in the refrigerator.<INSTR_END><TITLE_START>Naomi Duguid'S Chopped Roasted Peanuts<TITLE_END><RECIPE_END>"

Each time you pull the white chocolate out of the oven, it should look closer and closer to a caramel color and have a smoother and smoother consistency.<NEXT_INSTR>After 4 to 5 intervals or about 40 minutes, the white chocolate should be a deep beige color and smooth in texture. The caramelized white chocolate can now be used for a variety of recipes, in place of regular white chocolate. Drizzle it on top of baked goods, use as the base of a buttercream or frosting, or let it harden at room temperature and mix it into cookies or scones. Enjoy!<NEXT_INSTR>Note: Be sure the white chocolate you're using is true white chocolate, not white chocolate coating or white chocolate morsels. Also make sure to use a high-quality white chocolate that is high in cocoa butter, about 30%. Many of the quality brands will list the approximate percentage. Brands like Valrhona, Callebaut, and Scharffenberger are good choices.<INSTR_END><TITLE_START>Caramelized White Chocolate<TITLE_END><RECIPE_END>"

"<RECIPE_START><INPUT_START>Bananas<INPUT_END><INGR_START>2 whole Large Bananas<INGR_END><INSTR_START>Slice bananas into approximately 1/4 inch slices (medallions). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Lay the banana slices on the parchment paper, allowing the slices space in between so as not to touch each other (if they touch, they become more difficult to puree). Place in the freezer and freeze overnight, or for at least 3-4 hours to allow to fully harden.<NEXT_INSTR>Once frozen, place the banana slices into the bowl of a food processor. Pulse the banana in the food processor. At first, the the banana will look crumbly. Scrape down the sides of the food processor with a spatula. Continue blending and the banana will start to look mushy. Scrape down the sides of the food processor again. Continue blending until the last tiny pieces of banana smooth out. The consistency will turn from blended banana to a soft-serve ice cream texture. At this point, if you wanted to add in chocolate chips or cinnamon or another addition, do so.<NEXT_INSTR>While you could eat the ice cream right now, it will be super soft, so I recommend transferring it to an airtight container and freezing until solid, approximately 1-2 hours.
