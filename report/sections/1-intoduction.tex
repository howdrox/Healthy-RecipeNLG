\section{Introduction}

Home cooks and diet conscious individuals frequently rely on automated meal planning tools, yet these systems often fail to incorporate essential nutritional constraints such as low glycemic index (GI), low sugar, and balanced macronutrients. This gap is particularly problematic for users managing conditions like diabetes or seeking to maintain stable blood glucose levels.

In this work, we present a personalized recipe generation framework that transforms a large language model into a health aware assistant. Rather than computing exact nutritional values—which requires detailed ingredient data and complex modeling—we adopt a practical strategy: we fine tune GPT-2 on a carefully filtered subset of the RecipeNLG corpus containing only low GI recipes. This allows the model to internalize patterns of health compliant meal composition while retaining linguistic fluency and structural coherence.

By conditioning on user provided ingredient lists, our system generates recipes that align with dietary guidelines without demanding expert knowledge from end users. We demonstrate that a standard transformer decoder, once exposed exclusively to nutritious recipe examples, can output meal instructions that are both plausible in the kitchen and consistent with health goals. In doing so, we bridge the gap between cutting edge natural language generation and real world nutritional planning.
