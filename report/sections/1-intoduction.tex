\section{Introduction}

Existing recipe generators often ignore dietary restrictions like low-glycemic needs for diabetes, producing meal plans misaligned with medical guidelines. This limits effective, personalized meal planning for health-conscious individuals.

We present a recipe generator for healthy recipes. Has it ever happened to you that you wanted to cook something you look into your fridge and can't come up with a recipe? Or you have a recipe in mind but you don't have all the ingredients? And you care about your health and want to eat healthy? This is where our recipe generator comes in. It takes a list of ingredients you have at home and generates a healthy recipe based on those ingredients. The recipe is generated using a large language model (LLM) that has been fine-tuned on a dataset of healthy recipes.

To do this we retrained an GPT-2 model on a dataset of healthy recipes.
